; No matter where the smallest number is in the list, the function needs to go through every element becasue the input is not sorted. For this reason, the best case and worst case are the same for this function.

; Based on the hand evaluation, we learned that every function call either output (first l), or create one new recusive call.

; The order of n is n where n is the (length input).
