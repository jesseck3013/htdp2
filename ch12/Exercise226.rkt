(define-struct transition [current next])
; A Transition is a structure:
;   (make-transition FSM-State FSM-State)
 
; FSM-State is a Color.
 
; interpretation An FSM represents the transitions that a
; finite state machine can take from one state to another 
; in reaction to keystrokes

; A Color is one of: 
; — "white"
; — "yellow"
; — "orange"
; — "green"
; — "red"
; — "blue"
; — "black"
