; Starting from the smaller number from n and m, the function checks if this number is GCD between n and m. If it is not the GCD, the function recursively subtracts the number by 1 and check it is a GCD again, until the number becomes 1.

; Because any number that is larger than (min n m) is impossible to be their GCD.
