; Two data inputs are not in the same structure.
; They cannot be processed at the same time.
; Since there is a subst helper function which traverses
; the given S-expression, we can see the s-expression as an
; atomic value and use the subst function to traverse it.

; If we have another helper function that traverse the AL, we
; can see AL as the atomic value in the main function.
