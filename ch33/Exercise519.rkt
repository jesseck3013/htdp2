; The extra cost is memory usage. Whether it is acceptable depends on the actual use cases and the system that runs the program.

; 1. Suppose length is barely used, then it is not worth to make the change.

; 2. Suppose the program should be run on a system that has less memory, then we have to rethink if the system can support the new implementation.
